### Why?

I'll upload more to this later. However, using this method will allow you to compute large scale exponents in very short amounts of computation time. 

The drawback? Yes, the larger the value, the more variance in the answer. This won't always produce Exact values, but approximate values. As the base number becomes more complex from whole values, in combination
with large scale exponents. The float point rounding that computational languages inheirently have, will effect the final value. As a generality for estimation or approximation this works fantastic. As we can run trials of
exponential values to understand behavior, or create behavior in seconds. As opposed to waiting days at times for computations to complete. If you don't immediately overload your memory. 

Rust: Cause a friend dared me to convert it for Rust.
